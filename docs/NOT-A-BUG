- All local lists (Watchlist, Favorites, History, etc.): since we fetch
  MAX_VIDEOS results instead of all results, reaching the end of
  the list, then going to the empty screen (outbounds, no more results),
  then going back to the 1st page may result in that the last page will
  have MAX_VIDEOS results, while the 1st page - less than MAX_VIDEOS.
  This is a normal behavior.
